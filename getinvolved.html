                            and events to show off our robot and teach kids about STEM.

                            the Iowa City Arts Festival.
                            We also run <a href="//camp.iowacityrobotics.org">educational camps</a> in robotics and programming for kids from 3rd to 8th grade.

                            If you are unable to directly support Team 167, volunteering with FIRST is another great opportunity.
                            Alumni, parents, and anyone interested in STEM are all encouraged to volunteer at FIRST events.
